trigger: "When the user asks to review a skill, check skill quality, or validate skill best practices."
description: Review Skill definition quality. Use when user asks to "review skill", "check skill quality", "validate skill", "lint skill", "review my skill", or wants to check if a Skill follows best practices. For execution trace analysis, use when user explicitly mentions "analyze execution", "review trace", or "evaluate execution process". Do NOT use for runtime debugging (use agent-debug skill), code review (use code-review skill), or general file validation.

# Skill Reviewer

Review Skill definition quality against best practices.

## Default Mode: Definition Review

**CRITICAL**: When user says "review skill", ALWAYS default to **Definition Review** mode. Only switch to Execution Review when user **explicitly** mentions execution-related keywords.

**Default behavior**: Check the **Skill definition quality** (SKILL.md, structure, content).

**Execution Review**: Only when user **explicitly** mentions:
- "analyze execution"
- "review trace"
- "evaluate execution process"
- "执行过程评估"

| Mode | When to Use | Input |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Definition Review** (Default) | "review skill", "check quality", "validate" | Skill folder path |
| **Execution Review** (Explicit) | "analyze execution", "review trace" | Execution trace + goal |

---

## Example

**User**: "Review my skill at ./my-skill/"

**Actions**:
1. Read folder structure: `ls -la ./my-skill/`
2. Check SKILL.md exists and parse YAML frontmatter
3. Run 21-item checklist (S1-S4, F1-F6, C1-C8, T1-T3)
4. Generate review report

**Result**:
```
# 🔍 Skill Review: my-skill
| Category | ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warn | ❌ Fail |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Structure | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Format | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Content | 6 | 2 | 0 |
| Trigger | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **18** | **2** | **0** |

## Mode A: Definition Review

**Purpose**: Check if a Skill follows best practices and standards.

### When to Use

- Before publishing a new Skill
- After modifying a Skill
- Want to improve Skill quality

### Input

```
Required: Skill folder path (e.g., ./skill/ or ./my-skill/)
```

### Four-Category Checklist

| Category | Focus | Items |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 📁 Structure | File/folder layout | S1-S4 |
| 📋 Format | YAML frontmatter | F1-F6 |
| 📝 Content | Instructions quality | C1-C8 |
| 🎯 Trigger | Activation design | T1-T3 |

> See `references/definition-checklist.md` for complete 21-item checklist

### Workflow

```
Step 1: Read Skill folder structure
        ↓
Step 2: Check Structure (S1-S4)
        ↓
Step 3: Check Format (F1-F6)
        ↓
Step 4: Check Content (C1-C8)
        ↓
Step 5: Check Trigger (T1-T3)
        ↓
Step 6: Output report
```

### Output Format

```markdown
# 🔍 Skill Review: {skill-name}

> Path: `{skill-path}`

## Mode B: Execution Review

**Purpose**: Analyze Skill/Tool/Agent execution through three-layer progressive analysis.

```
L1 Engineering Correctness ──▶ L2 Goal Achievement ──▶ L3 Optimization Space
   Is execution correct?         Is effect good?          Can it be better?
```

### When to Use

- Skill/Tool execution results don't meet expectations
- Agent behavior is abnormal and needs troubleshooting
- Want to systematically improve implementation

### Four Input Dimensions

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Execution Trace | Tool calls, output, errors | ✅ Yes |
| Execution Goal | Original prompt | ✅ Yes |
| Implementation Reference | Skill/Tool definition | Optional |
| Agent Implementation | Agent source | Optional |

> See `references/input-guide.md` for details

### Three-Layer Analysis

#### L1: Engineering Correctness

**Question: Is execution correct?**

- Are tool calls successful?
- Do scripts execute without errors?
- Any Linter/syntax errors?
- Any infinite loops?

**Judgment:** If errors found → Report and stop, fix L1 first

#### L2: Goal Achievement

**Question: Is the effect good?**

- Is the goal correctly understood?
- Are key steps executed?
- How is output format/quality?

**Rating:** ✓✓✓ Excellent / ✓✓ Good / ✓ Pass / ✗ Fail

#### L3: Optimization Space

**Question: Can it be better?** (Prerequisite: L1 pass + L2 at least pass)

**[MUST] Check these dimensions:**
- **Efficiency**: Redundant calls? Token waste? Repeated reads?
- **Implementation**: Better tools? Clearer description? Scripts simplifiable?
- **Conciseness**: Redundant content? Over-explanation?

> See `references/analysis-dimensions.md` for details

### Workflow

```
Step 1: Collect inputs
        ↓
Step 2: Read implementation reference (if available)
        ↓
Step 3: L1 scan → Report if issues found
        ↓
Step 4: L2 comparison → Evaluate achievement
        ↓
Step 5: L3 optimization → Generate suggestions
        ↓
Step 6: Output report
        ↓
Step 7: (Optional) Generate execution plan if user adopts suggestions
```

> See `references/execution-guide.md` for execution plan generation

### Output Format

```markdown
## Execution Review Report

### Basic Information
| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| Analysis Target | {Skill/Tool/Agent} |
| Execution Goal | "{prompt}" |

### L1: Engineering Correctness ✓/✗
[Check result table]

### L2: Goal Achievement ✓✓
[Achievement status + Rating]

### L3: Optimization Space 💡
[Suggestions by dimension]

### Summary
[Core issues + Priority improvements]

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SKILL.md not found"
**Cause**: File missing or named incorrectly (SKILL.MD, skill.md, etc.)
**Solution**: Create `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive) in skill folder root

### Error: "YAML parse failed"
**Cause**: Invalid YAML syntax in frontmatter
**Solution**: Check for:
- Missing `---` delimiters
- Incorrect indentation
- Unescaped special characters in description

### Error: "name field invalid"
**Cause**: name contains spaces, capitals, or special characters
**Solution**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-skill-name`)

### Warning: "SKILL.md too long"
**Cause**: File exceeds 300 lines
**Solution**: Move detailed content to `references/` folder
