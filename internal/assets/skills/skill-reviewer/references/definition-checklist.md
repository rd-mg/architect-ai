## Status Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ | Pass | No action needed |
| ⚠️ | Warning | Consider improving |
| ❌ | Fail | Must fix |

---

## 📁 Structure (S1-S4)

### S1: SKILL.md Exists

**Check:** Entry file exists with correct naming.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | File exists and named exactly `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive) |
| ❌ Fail | File missing or named incorrectly (SKILL.MD, skill.md, etc.) |

**Detection:** Programmatic (file system check)

### S2: Folder Naming

**Check:** Skill folder uses kebab-case naming.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | kebab-case (e.g., `my-skill`, `skill-reviewer`) |
| ⚠️ Warn | Contains underscore (e.g., `my_skill`) - works but non-standard |
| ❌ Fail | Contains spaces or capitals (e.g., `My Skill`, `MySkill`) |

**Detection:** Programmatic (regex: `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`)

### S3: Directory Structure

**Check:** Optional directories used correctly.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Uses standard optional directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` |
| ⚠️ Warn | Missing optional directories (acceptable if not needed) |
| ❌ Fail | Contains forbidden `README.md` in skill folder |

**Detection:** Programmatic (directory listing)

**Standard Structure:**
```
your-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required
├── scripts/              # Optional - executable code
├── references/           # Optional - documentation
└── assets/               # Optional - templates, resources
```

### S4: Name Consistency

**Check:** Folder name matches `name` field in frontmatter.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Folder name and `name` field are identical |

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Clear statement of purpose/function |
| ⚠️ Warn | Vague (e.g., "Helps with projects") |
| ❌ Fail | No purpose statement |

**Detection:** Model-based (semantic analysis)

**Good Examples:**
```yaml
description: "Analyzes Figma design files and generates developer handoff documentation."
description: "Review and validate Skill definitions against best practices."
```

**Bad Examples:**
```yaml
description: "Helps with projects."        # Too vague
description: "Use when needed."            # No WHAT
```

### C2: Description Contains WHEN

**Check:** Description includes trigger conditions.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Clear trigger phrases (e.g., "Use when user asks to...") |
| ⚠️ Warn | Has trigger intent but not specific |
| ❌ Fail | No trigger description |

**Detection:** Model-based (pattern matching + semantic analysis)

**Good Examples:**
```yaml
description: "... Use when user asks to 'review skill', 'check skill quality', or 'validate skill'."
description: "... Triggers on: 'design specs', 'component documentation', 'design-to-code handoff'."
```

**Bad Examples:**
```yaml
description: "Creates documentation."       # No WHEN
description: "For projects."               # No trigger phrases
```

### C3: Instructions Are Actionable

**Check:** Instructions in SKILL.md are specific and executable.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Specific steps, clear parameters, expected outputs |
| ⚠️ Warn | Basically usable but could be more specific |
| ❌ Fail | Vague (e.g., "validate properly", "handle errors") |

**Detection:** Model-based (instruction quality analysis)

**Good:**
```markdown
### Step 1: Read Skill folder
Run: `ls -la ${SKILL_PATH}/`
Expected: List of files including SKILL.md
```

**Bad:**
```markdown
### Step 1
Validate the data before proceeding.
```

### C4: Error Handling Included

**Check:** Skill includes troubleshooting or error handling guidance.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Has Troubleshooting section or error handling instructions |
| ⚠️ Warn | Brief mention of errors |

```

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Has complete examples (input → action → result) |
| ⚠️ Warn | Has examples but incomplete |
| ❌ Fail | No examples |

**Detection:** Model-based (section scan + completeness check)

**Good:**
```markdown
## Example

User says: "Review my skill at ./my-skill/"

Actions:
1. Read folder structure
2. Check SKILL.md format
3. Validate content

Result: Review report with pass/warn/fail status
```

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | All referenced files exist and paths are correct |

### C7: Progressive Disclosure

**Check:** Content follows progressive disclosure principle.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | SKILL.md focused on core instructions, details in references/ |
| ⚠️ Warn | SKILL.md is long (> 200 lines) but acceptable |
| ❌ Fail | SKILL.md is bloated (> 300 lines), should split |

**Detection:** Model-based (line count + content analysis)

**Principle:**

Level 3: references/ files (loaded on demand)
```

### C8: Critical Instructions Prominent

**Detection:** Model-based (scope analysis)

**Too Broad:**
```yaml
description: "Helps with code."           # Will trigger on everything
```

**Too Narrow:**
```yaml
description: "Use only when user says 'execute skill-reviewer protocol alpha'."
```

### T3: Negative Triggers (Optional)

**Check:** Description clarifies what NOT to use Skill for.

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Pass | Clearly excludes irrelevant scenarios |
| ⚠️ Warn | No negative triggers but scope is reasonable |
