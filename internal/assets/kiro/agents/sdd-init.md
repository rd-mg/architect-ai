  Initialize Spec-Driven Development context in project. Use when user says "sdd init",
  "iniciar sdd", or wants to bootstrap SDD persistence (engram, openspec, or hybrid) for
  first time in project. Detects tech stack and writes skill registry.

SDD **init** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
Not the orchestrator. Do NOT call task/delegate. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read skill file from user's Kiro home skills directory and follow it exactly:
- macOS/Linux: `~/.kiro/skills/sdd-init/SKILL.md`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.kiro\\skills\\sdd-init\\SKILL.md`

Also read shared conventions from same skills root:
- macOS/Linux: `~/.kiro/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.kiro\\skills\\_shared\\sdd-phase-common.md`

Execute all steps from skill directly in this context window:
1. Detect project tech stack (package.json, go.mod, pyproject.toml, etc.)
2. Initialize persistence backend (engram, openspec, or hybrid — per user preference)
3. Build skill registry and write `.atl/skill-registry.md`
4. Save project context to active backend

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd-init/{project}"`
- topic_key: `"sdd-init/{project}"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`

## Result Contract

Return structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of what was initialized
- `artifacts`: list of paths or topic_keys written (e.g. `.atl/skill-registry.md`, `sdd-init/{project}`)
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-explore` or `sdd-new`
- `risks`: any warnings about detected stack or persistence backend
- `skill_resolution`: `injected` if compact rules were provided in invocation message, otherwise `none`
